# Technologies used
HTML - CSS - JS

# Installation Guide
For the installation, If you access the game via the websit that I deployed you can go ahead and play the game. On the other hand, 
If you want to see my code and playaround with my code all you need is to just grab all of my HTML, CSS and JS together and there you go !

# User story
The Spaceman game is a guessing word game which the player will be giving the empty space (In my case 4 letters) and then you will need to guessing each word by pressing any keys on your keyboard. If the letter you choose are not match with any of the word behind our scene your chance will start decreasing starting from 8 and luckily if you pressing the right word your turn left will not be decrease and that letter will also appear on the screen on the position of that whole word. Another thing to keep in mind if you lose the game you can click on the Re-start button to restart the game anytime you want. Alright enough talk let get start the game together :)

# Struggleness and lesson learnt
From the day 1 as a junior developer when you decide to stop continue learning from tutorial I personally think that my learning speed is really improve and I was able to grasp more understand when compare to learning from watching tutorial(I did't mean online course is bad both of them work depend on your learning style) So, for this project I learnt a lot of the concept that already been taught and put it into practice. On of the example of what I learnt was that I was able to understand why function can make your entire codebase clean and keep your code DRY( Which is stand for don't repeat yourself) thus when you want to perform some action to other area or event you can recall that function() again without a need to write it all up again. Another lesson that I learnt is that sometime problem that you are currently face right now may seem like so difficult I recommend to take a break and be patience to come back again and splice the problem into small chunk that way you will find a way to solve your problem more easily. In conclusion, I think programming is more about think than typing but without typing your real learning will never begin. Keep calm and keep coding guys cheers !
